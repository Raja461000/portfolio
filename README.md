## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

### Tech Stacks:

Power BI
Power Point
Excel
Language-  DAX

### Workflow steps:


- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except column named "Arrival Delay".
- Step 5 :Data Modelling and creating calculated columns.
Creating measures using the DAX language.
Build Executive View, Finance View, Revenue View, Occupancy and - - Step 6 : Booking View and Key Metrics View.
- Step 7 : Designing an effective Dashboard which includes page navigation with buttons, tooltips, using KPI’s, conditional formatting of the values in visuals.
- Step 8 : Publish or Deploying the solution using Power BI Service.

### Key metrics:

Revenue realized: 1.69 billion rupees
RevPAR: 7,337
DSRN: 2,528
Occupancy percentage: 57.8%
ADR: 12.70K
Realization percentage: 70.1%

### Recommendations:

Atliq Grands, a luxury hotel in Delhi, despite its good ratings, is underperforming in revenue generation. A strategic plan is needed to boost bookings and reduce cancellations.
Atliq Palace in Hyderabad is struggling with low bookings, potentially due to low ratings. As a business hotel, its high ADR of 9,480 rupees and low Occupancy percentage need attention.
Atliq Grands in Hyderabad is another hotel with lower revenue due to poor ratings and low Occupancy percentage. Efforts should focus on increasing bookings.
The decline in revenue is primarily linked to low Occupancy percentages, which, in turn, result from fewer bookings. Strategies should be devised to enhance booking rates.
ADR should be adjusted dynamically based on factors like the city, weekdays, and low-demand days to maximize revenue.
Finally, I would like to thank codebasics team, Dhaval Patel, Hemanand Vadivel for creating this wonderful course.
